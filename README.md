# SearchGiphyApp
Giphy app with search option

* The song we hear when we are entering the app is a song for improving the feeling because everyone who hears it has immediately a smile on his face.

* The app is performing an infinite list of the Giphies according to the user search.

* The app uses the MVC architecture - I preferred this architecture instead of the MVVM architecture, because I'm more familiar with the MVC and I wanted to perform my best.

* Implementations used in this app:
  - Small animations with iOS frameworks to make the app look better
  - Used the "ImageIOSwift" and "ImageIOUIKit" third party library to implement the Gif view to animate the Gif itself.
  - When scrolling the search down it gives you infinite results for the connected search input.
  - Tapping a Gif from the search list will present a full screen Gif preview.
  - Implemented a favorite list the user can manage by adding and removing Gifs to the list
  - Implemented a "Save to camera roll" option for the user to save the Gif directly to his gallery on his phone.
  - Implemented a "share" option for the user to share the Gif where ever you wish.
  
* I would like to say that I really enjoyed working and building the app, I also learned new things about animations that I didn't know before.

Hope you will enjoy the app.
Guy Twig.
